\textbf{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}

\item AOD has a linear relationship with the PM$_{2.5}$ measurements.
\item Meteorological information is also important in predicting PM$_{2.5}$ (particularly wind speed).
\item GAM model better than multivariate linear regression model better than mixed effects model.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Future work}
\begin{itemize}

\item Perform analysis on Hawaii sites. 
\item Use data from more years to train our model.
\item Performing spatio-temporal analysis. 
\end{itemize}

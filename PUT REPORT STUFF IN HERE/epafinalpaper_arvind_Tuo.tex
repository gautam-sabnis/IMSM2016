\centerline{\bf Abstract}

Long term exposure to PM$_{2.5}$ is associated with human health complications (insert citation). Surface readings of PM$_{2.5}$ in the states on the West Coast of the United States have reported to be higher than allowed by the Clean Air Act. One possible reason for this is international transport of air pollution on PM$_{2.5}$. This project explores the relationship between the surface readings of PM$_{2.5}$ from coastal sites with the AOD measurements from the AVHRR in these regions. Once we found a correlation between these readings, we implemented a model to approximate PM$_{2.5}$ concentrations in the Pacific ocean, where surface readings are not possible.

\section{Introduction}
\arvind{This is not the right material to be covered in an introduction, so I have reorderded. The  introduction should roughly cover the following points
\begin{itemize}
\item A bird's eye view of the problem, i.e. adverse effect of pollution
\item Review of previous work and main findings (the three papers Brett sent)
\item What the main goals of this paper are (essentially paraphrasing Elizabeth's and Brett's goals). 
\item Our main contributions in this report. 
\end{itemize}
}

Domestic sources of emissions are the primary cause of air pollution in the U.S.; however, there is potential for international flow of air pollution into the U.S. to be a contributing factor in some coastal cities having high recorded measurements of air pollution. The impact that international transport of air pollution has on our ability to attain air quality standards or other environmental objectives in the U.S. has yet to be fully characterized. In other words, cities in the western U.S. may unknowingly be receiving high pollutant values through no fault to themselves. The goal in this project is to establish a connection between AOT measurements from the AVHRR satellite to determine the impact of international transport of air pollution on PM$_{2.5}$ concentrations in coastal areas of the western U.S. We examined PM$_{2.5}$ sites that were close to the coast. Most of our sites were situated in California, with a few in Washington and a handful in Hawaii. The map in figure 1 shows the 13 sites that were used along the Western U.S. coast. 



For this project, we used two different sources of data -- Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) obtained from satellite measurements, and surface PM$_{2.5}$ measurements. ~\arvind{Please explicitly define AOT. }
PM$_{2.5}$ is particulate matter that is less than $2.5$ micrometers in diameter and is often referred to as the greatest health risk of pollutants~\cite{epa}.

\section{The Problem}

\subsection{Description of data}

The first data set of Climate Data Record (CDR) of AOT was obtained from by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)~\cite{noaa}. This data was collected using the  Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) that provides an optical measure of aerosol column loading derived form the global ocean pixel-level PATMOS-x AVHRR clear-sky reflectance CDR at $0.63$ $\mu$m channel~\cite{noaa}. This satellite provides global readings of oceanic measurements of AOT on a daily, as well as a monthly scale, for the years $1981$-$2009$~\cite{noaa}.

The second data set consisting of the PM$_{2.5}$ measurements, was taken on land sites in California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii. This was provided by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).   PM$_{2.5}$ is so small that it can get lodged into lungs and make it difficult for people to breath. This creates an increase in respiratory problems. Common contributing factors to PM$_{2.5}$ include emissions for motor vehicles, power plants, wood burning, and dust from paved or unpaved roads, \cite{epa}.

The AVHRR takes approximately $16$ days to cover the entire earth. We, thus, have roughly two data values for each month of the year. The frequency of the PM$_{2.5}$ data is variable and ranges from once every day to once every six days. On certain occassions, the measurements from the satellite were found to be  erroneous due to light reflection from cloud covers. Additionally, there are times when the PM$_{2.5}$ sensors malfunctioned resulting in no data. These points were appropriately removed from the datasets. Hence, we sometimes have months that have only two or less PM$_{2.5}$ data and/or no AOT data. 

\subsection{Challenges}
\arvind{Here I would list the challenges associated with the data, lack of spatial and temporal coverage, etc. The differences between what we would like to have vs what we have instead.}
\section{The Approach}

\subsection{Data processing}
\arvind{Describe what other preprocessing was done to the data.} 

%\subsubsection{Clean the AVHRR AOD data}

No matter what PM2.5 sites we use, we need to find the closest AOD coordinates to the PM2.5 sites, and then to match the sites data for each day. This requires us to search all the observations in AOD dataset. The AOD data are very large and we cannot put all the data in hundreds of files into one matrix. Besides, AOD data have lots of missing data. So we need to clean the AOD data first. 

Since the data we want to use are the data located on the west coast and Hawaii, first we used the longitude and latitude of the west coast and Hawaii to eliminate data from other locations that we won\rq t use. Then, we dropped all the missing data and also changed the original format of the data into more readable one. Finally, our AOD data looks like Table \ref{table3.1}. 

\subsection{PM$_{2.5}$ sites adjacent to AVHRR grids}
Since the coverage of the AOT data is over the oceans, and the PM$_{2.5}$ data is collected over the land, there is no direct overlap between the two datasets. In order to compare the two data sets, we adopt the following strategy. First, of all the PM$_{2.5}$ measurement sites, we identify those that are close to the coast. Figure~\ref{graph3} shows the geographical location of all the PM$_{2.5}$ sites, whereas Figure~\ref{graph4} shows the geographical locations to $13$ locations -- four of these are found in California, whereas the rest can be found in Hawaii.  In the rest of this report, we focus on only these $13$ locations. \arvind{Can you also mention that we only chose overlapping temporal data.}


%As AVHRR satellites can only get the aerosol optical depth (AOD) from oceans and PM$_{2.5}$ data are from lands, our strategy for identifying PM$_{2.5}$ sites is to choose the ones that are as close to the coast as possible.  The sites were chosen due to their proximity to the west coast.

\label{graph4}
\end{figure}




\subsection{Analzing PM$_{2.5}$ trends}
One method we used to analyze trends in the PM$_{2.5}$ data was to make an animation to show the change in the concentration of PM$_{2.5}$  over time. The animation plots points at each site where the PM$_{2.5}$ data was collected, with color varying depending on the intensity of the reading, with darker colors indicating a larger concentration of PM$_{2.5}$. 

\arvind{Tuo: Please describe the time-series models you used to analyse PM data}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%Tuo1
To figure out whether we can use previous PM2.5 value to predict future PM2.5 value, we decide to conduct time series analysis. We focus our attention on the PM2.5 site which located at latitude 33.79236 and longitude -118.175 ( It is really close to Long Beach). We collect monthly average PM2.5 concentration value from Jan 2004 to Dec 2014 and plot the time series in the figure below.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 90mm]{ts1.png}
%\caption{}
%\label{graph4}
\end{figure}

There is a slightly downward trend over time about this time series and there seems to exist seasonality. We decide to use two different methods to fit the time series model. One is Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing. Exponential smoothing is a very popular scheme to produce a smoothed time series and it assigns exponentially decreasing weights as the observations get older. Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing can be used to make short-term forecasts on a time series that can be described using an additive model with increasing or decreasing trend and seasonality. The second one is ARIMA model. ARIMA is the short for autoregressive integrated moving average. This model can be fitted to time series data either to better understand the data or to predict future points in the series. For the ARIMA method, we firstly adjust the time series by subtracting the estimated seasonal component and then apply the model to the adjusted series.

\arvind{The results of the experiments should be discussed in the next section}.
After analyzing this data we noticed (insert conclusion here... talk about it more...). The animation is available online (insert website-github?).

\subsection{Relationships between AVHRR AOD and surface PM$_{2.5}$}
We noticed that there was a huge difference between the  $13$ sites we identified along the West Coast and the sites located on Hawaii. The sites on Hawaii are unique because Hawaii is surrounded on water. Thus we decided to build models separately for both the sites along the West Coast and the sites on Hawaii. 

\arvind{Yu: Describe the random effects model here. }

\end{tabular}
\caption{AOD data}
\label{table3.1}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Match the AOD data with the PM2.5 data}
As we are trying to find the relationships between AOD and PM2.5, we need to keep all the date the same, and locations closest. After matching these two datasets, we got the following as in Table {table3.2}.

\begin{table}[!h]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Computational Experiments}
\arvind{I suggest organizing this section into a series of experiments. Here are a few suggestions. You can also follow the instructions at the end of the section.}

\subsection{Experiment 1: Analysis of PM25 time series}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%Tuo2
\subsubsection{Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing}
We firstly draw fitted value plot based on Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing. In the plot below, black line represents the variation of real PM value during 2004-2014 and red line represents the variation of fitted PM value during the period. We can see that although the two lines have similar trend, the fitted value is not accurate enough at many points.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 90mm]{ts2.png}
%\caption{}
%\label{graph4}
\end{figure}

Then we predict the PM2.5 concentration value for the whole year 2015. In the plot below, the blue line represents the predicted value for 2015. The shadow of deep color represents the 80\% prediction interval for the predicted value and the shadow of light color represents the 95\% prediction interval for the predicted value.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 90mm]{ts3.png}
%\caption{}
%\label{graph4}
\end{figure}

Now let?u exmaine the effect of our prediction. We decide to use mean square error as our criterion. Lower mean square error indicates we have a better prediction. By comparing the predicted results and the real PM value for the year 2015, we find the mean square error between them is around 5.5. Becaues the mean of PM2.5 value during 2004-2014 is about 12.6, the mean square error is kind of large and this model is not very accurate.

\subsubsection{ARIMA model}
Becaues there seems to exist seasonality in the PM2.5 value time series, we want to decompose the time series and apply ARIMA model to the adjusted time series. We first decompose the PM2.5 concentration value time series and plot it. In the plot below, the four subplots respectively represent observed value, overall trend component, seasonal component and random part. From the seasonal component, we can see that there does exist differences of PM2.5 value among different months. By subtracting the seasonal component from the original time series, we get adjusted PM2.5 concentration value time series.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 90mm]{ts4.png}
%\caption{}
%\label{graph4}
\end{figure}

Then we draw fitted adjusted PM value based on ARIMA model. The black line represents the variation of real adjusted PM value during 2004-2014 and red line represents the variation of fitted adjusted PM value during the period. From this plot we can see that the fitted line is really rough.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 90mm]{ts5.png}
%\caption{}
%\label{graph4}
\end{figure}

Next, we predict the adjusted PM2.5 concentration value for the whole year 2015. Similar as before, , the blue line represents the predicted value for 2015. The shadow of deep color represents the 80\% prediction interval for the predicted value and the shadow of light color represents the 95\% prediction interval for the predicted value.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 90mm]{ts6.png}
%\caption{}
%\label{graph4}
\end{figure}

Finally, we adding seasonal component to our predicted result and then compare it with the real PM value during 2004-2014. We find the mean square error is around 9.7. So the performance of ARIMA model is even not as good as Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing.In sum, the effect of prediction by time series is not very good. But it does give us some inspiration. For example, the PM 2.5 value will be different in different seasons. For next step, we should combine PM2.5 value and some other covariates to construct a better model.

\subsection{Experiment 2: PM 25 vs AOT data}
with and without adding covariates


\subsubsection{relationships between AVHRR AOD and surface PM2.5 for sites closest to the west coast}

For sites closest to the west coast, we finally found 4 sites that have common date information. Figure \ref{fig3.3} is the plot regarding the AOD and PM2.5 by each site. 

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{3.pdf}
\caption{PM vs. AOD for each site close to the west coast}
\label{fig3.3}
\end{figure}

We can see from the above plot that the relationships between AOD and PM2.5 are different for different sites. So we consider building different models for each site to find the relationships.

\subsubsection{relationships between AVHRR AOD and surface PM2.5 for Hawaii sites}

For Hawaii sites, we finally found 9 sites that have common date information. Figure \ref{fig3.4} is the plot regarding the AOD and PM2.5 by each site. 

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{1.pdf}
\caption{PM vs. AOD for each Hawaii site}
\label{fig3.4}
\end{figure}

Similarly, we can see from the above plot that the relationships between AOD and PM2.5 are different for different sites. Like what we did for sites close to the west coast, we consider building different models for each site to find the relationships.
